In recent years, the trend of artists collaborating on songs has become increasingly prevalent. This analysis examines whether this shift is reflected in the data, specifically focusing on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. By parsing and analyzing data from 1958 to 2021, this study investigates the frequency and impact of collaborations versus solo performances among top-charting artists.

The analysis reveals a significant rise in the number of collaborative tracks over time, with a notable decrease in songs released by solo artists. Moreover, the study explores the relationship between the number of collaborators and the success of a song, finding that increased collaborations are associated with higher peak rankings and longer durations on the Billboard charts.

This study underscores the growing importance of collaborations in achieving commercial success in the music industry, as evidenced by the trends observed on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.
